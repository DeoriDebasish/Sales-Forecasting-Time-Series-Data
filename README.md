- Less sales are done on Holidays as compared to non-holidays.
- Different types of stores experience different sale volumes.
- Store in different regions experience different sale volumes.
- Order and Sales are correlated.

## ML Modeling:
- Building 2 types of models
    - Regression models
    - Time series models
- For regression models
    - Linear Regression model
    - XGboost Regressor
- For Time Series model
    - SARIMA
    - SARIMAX
    - Prophet

 ## Deployment
 - Selected sarima and sarimax models and pickled those models
 - After pickling the models we build a python app and deploy it on streamlit.
